# Results Directory

This directory stores output visualizations and analysis results.

## Generated Files

When you run the notebook, the following files will be generated:

### Visualizations
- `confusion_matrix_comparison.png` - Side-by-side comparison of standard vs advanced approaches
- `accuracy_comparison.png` - Bar chart comparing model accuracies
- `classification_reports.txt` - Detailed classification metrics

### Data Files
- `performance_metrics.csv` - Numerical results for all models
- `predictions_sample.csv` - Sample predictions with actual labels

## Viewing Results

All visualizations are displayed inline in the Jupyter notebook. Files saved here serve as permanent records.

## Note

Result files are excluded from version control (`.gitignore`) but can be regenerated by running the notebook.

# Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models.

## Generated Files

When you run the notebook, the following model files will be saved here:

- `logistic_standard.pkl` - Logistic Regression with standard preprocessing
- `logistic_advanced.pkl` - Logistic Regression with advanced preprocessing
- `svc_standard.pkl` - Linear SVC with standard preprocessing
- `svc_advanced.pkl` - Linear SVC with advanced preprocessing

## Loading Saved Models

You can load and reuse trained models:

```python
import pickle

# Load a saved model
with open('models/logistic_advanced.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Note

Model files are excluded from version control (`.gitignore`) due to large file sizes.
